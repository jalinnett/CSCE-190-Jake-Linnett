Our problem statement began with making a solution for people struggling with wanting to start working out but being inable to create a viable plan. In our Jamboard it 
has 5 sections including, how to make this program, the demographic, how an app could be made, expenses, and user interaction.</p>

My storyboard has to deal with the main character George, who feels like he needs to get more active after sitting in his office for work all day. After his coworker reccomends a fitness app that can help come up with a workout plan, he uses it for a few months and is in now the best shape of his life
